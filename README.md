**Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN)** - makes it easy for you to build reliable private networks, allowing for secure and seamless communication across the region

High bandwidth **Express Connect**-based VPC interconnection

**Anti-DDoS security service** 
- the use of VPCs notonly ensures the security and reliability of your data but the VPC interconnection also guarantees the quality of communication across regions. 
- means your data is free to move across your network with low latency, high availability and robust security provisions in place to protect this information.

**IoT Platform** is also deployed, which provides secure and stable communication to the edge of your network. The low latency of the data transmission provides accurate predictions for parcel delivery times in real-time.

**Object Storage Service (OSS)**, which is an easyto- use service that enables you to store, backup and archive large amounts of data on the cloud. OSS acts as an encrypted central repository from where files can be securely accessed from around the globe and guarantees up to 99.9% availability.

**DataWorks** is our leading big data platform, which provides one-stop big data development, data permission management, offline job scheduling and many other features, all straight out of the box. This means that your team can use DataWorks with minimal training. This solution also provides a separate production and
development environment so you can safely test and debug your code.

**MaxCompute** - largescale data warehousing service, to seamlessly migrate your existing services to the cloud and shorten your data processing times significantly. MaxCompute supports various data importing solutions and distributed computing models, allowing you to effectively query massive datasets, reduce production costs, and ensure data security

big data processing solution, **Elastic MapReduce (E-MapReduce)** is also deployed. It is built on our **Elastic Compute Service (ECS)** and is based on the open source Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark processing tools.

**DataV** is a powerful data visualization tool. You can publish different projects for different enterprise customers as web pages, with secured password or access tokens, to help your logistics customers better understand relationships, patterns and trends in their data. DataV also provides a wide range of templates for all types of scenarios, which makes it easy for your development team to design, customize and render a range of high-quality representations without the aid of a designer.
