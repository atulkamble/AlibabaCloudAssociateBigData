**Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN)** - makes it easy for you to build reliable private networks, allowing for secure and seamless communication across the region

High bandwidth **Express Connect**-based VPC interconnection

**Anti-DDoS security service** 
- the use of VPCs notonly ensures the security and reliability of your data but the VPC interconnection also guarantees the quality of communication across regions. 
- means your data is free to move across your network with low latency, high availability and robust security provisions in place to protect this information.

**IoT Platform** is also deployed, which provides secure and stable communication to the edge of your network. The low latency of the data transmission provides accurate predictions for parcel delivery times in real-time.
